## About
Hi, My name is Himanshu Sah, and I am a full-stack web developer. I have been working on and learning [`MERN`](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) for over two years. I am interested in software development and web development. I can make [`API`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API#:~:text=An%20application%20programming%20interface%20(API,to%20other%20pieces%20of%20software))s and implement them using express and node js. 
I am also a sophomore at [`The University of Akron`](https://uakron.edu/) pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science. I am currently looking for an internship as a software developer.
